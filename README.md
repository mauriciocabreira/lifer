LIFER v1.0.0 

Lifer is an app to motivate people to exercise and eat more healthy. 
\Lifer\ in this scope is a person that enjoys life and users the exercise and healthy eating to clear the mind and worry less. At the end of the day, it is proven that exercising decrease stress. that, along with health habits keeps you fit. A healhty body elevates self-esteem, and people feel more confident on whatever they do. Enjoying life more, becoming a Lifer.

How it works:
-person is engade in a 21 day program with daily check-ins. Every day there is a quick chat with a bot that gives a star every time the person opens the app, confirms she/he exercised and ate healty. During the program Lifer bot collects the person weight and shows the total number of points (stars) person got.
-Person is reminded to open the app via local push notifications every day at 8m. She/he can log only the current day or day before. If you stay 2 days without opening the app you can't get the "open app stars"related to those past days.

The app will be improved in future with better chat conversations, a better dashboard, to be published in app store, after I finalize the iosND course and find some more free time.

Technology:
-it uses persistant data through firebase and some 3rd party pods
-interface is in portuguese, but english speaking people can manage to test it (Sim = yes, NÃ£o = no, that's all you need to know!

Building the app: install pods and run it. Create one account to use.

Although it seems very basic, it shows some of the stuff I have learnt in this great course.
